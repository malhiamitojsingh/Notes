`Minimalism` is state where every possession have some value in your daily life which you need and have some sentimental value. These are just bare minimum things which mean something to you in your life. 

Things Which Can Be Minimal:
- `Books` - E-books (digital)
- `Clothing`
- `Digital Minimalism` - one phone, one computer, one smart-watch, etc.
These are some examples but as a result everything can result as minimal. Basically, the main idea is to think with common sense and to question yourself "`Does this thing is of any use to me?`". If these types of questions result in "yes" purchase it otherwise forget it and never thought about it.
Think in this way, we purchase different things which are in trend at present but we don't think about the sustainability of that item. As a result, it become a thing which we never use and categorized as `extra`.

Benefits of Minimalism:
- `Savings` - If money get utilized properly only on essentials which we need and bare minimal wants then it will result in savings which can be used for investing.
-  `Clear Thinking` - We will able to focus on your possessions and take care of those as there is no extra things in your life.

So, at last I want to say that minimalism is process which have different meaning for everyone in the world. People should create there own rules as they are essential for carrying out something for longer period of time otherwise there will be no benchmark for comparing your progress.
