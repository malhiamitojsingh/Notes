# Do It Today
## Notes
### Part 1: Overcoming Procrastination
- **Do it today, Not tomorrow**: Neglecting hard things for longer period of time is a self destructive habit over a longer period of time. As, it will make you addictive to your comfort zone where you only touches the surface level difficulties to a subject and never able to think in depth. Different type of practices are available to remove procrastination like exercising, writing daily dairy to reflect on self and many more. Always keep in mind the things for which you have to work, It will help you to continue doing work that matter to you.
- **What I do When I can't focus**: So, there will be many things which will distract us when we working on things which matter to us in our life. But rather than focusing we get distracted with simple distractions. Try to find something which help you to stay focus which work for you it can be a place which is quite, mobile on DND mode or any thing else. We tend to go for cheap or we can say short term simulations when we are not happy or have negative thoughts in our mind which can be watching movie, music, or whatever that comes in this cheap simulation category. But always remember what is the end result if you chose this cheap simulation and neglect your work at present because short term doesn't work for life time.
- **How to beat procrastination**: Every procrastinator start with single excuse like rest for 5 minutes and goes on and on with other excuses to delay real work. This can be solved if we provide our doing some motivation like what we are working for what is our end goal. Then we have to just keep in mind that why we are working. Wait and Think for a moment - What matters more? 
- **How to stop wasting time and Improve your personal effectiveness**: Just track your daily things on hourly basis as to create a time log for your daily activities. It will work as a mirror for yourself where you will find time-waster activities which you can eliminate to become more effective. You can also apply this same thing on other things in your life for example money you spend create a log and for many other things as well.
- **The habits of unproductive people you don't want to copy**: Productivity doesn't matter, its just working on something even if it's not leading you toward your goals - What matter is Effectiveness. We only have present to work, as we know our past but don't know about our future but we can make our future better with being effective at present. We should focus on our present rather than things which can be possible in future. Build a system which make you effective like a second mind where you can write your tasks as well as your ideas, thoughts as well as other things for which you will use your mind. Create a life with rules, no rules in life is like living like animals. Rules are good, as they shape our life. 
- **This 30 minute evening ritual will help you to kick life in the ass**: Organizing your tomorrow will help you in morning when you will think about what today is about. So, create a ritual in evening where you will decide your tomorrow morning and tasks which include journal your day, deciding tomorrow tasks, preparation of outfit and that's it. Last thing that remain is - remembering these :)
- **Why disconnecting from the internet improves your focus**: Main idea here is, too much of anything is harmful even if its good things like food, love, or anything in this world. So why connecting to internet is an exception as it makes you a slave of those companies which try to lock you inside there system and make you a consumer. Disconnect from internet as much as possible because you will not regret this later, I promise.
- **The single biggest reason most people procrastinate in life**: Do what you love, find what you love to do because when you do what you love procrastination will be eliminated automatically. Everything is limited whether it's time, energy, or anything in this world even if it's money of the richest man in the world.
- **This ancient habit will maximize your focus**: Worrying about nonsense things never going to help you out. Be hard working and effective person that's it. Use a Mantra when you find yourself in a state where you feel it's not working out and you are feeling helpless - Waheguru.
- **How to focus better: manage your attention (not your time)**: Respect the time you have because 30 minute undisturbed work is better than 1 hour work with a mental condition of constant thinking about nonsense. So work on your attention span, try to improve your attention duration so you become more effective in an available time that you have.
